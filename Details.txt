Topics:

  1. Navigate: react-router-dom
    navigates to the specified route
    1. Navigate as component
    2. useNavigate hook as a function call

  2. Props Drilling:
      passing props from parent to children
      Drilling of a particular or group of props to two or more levels of components

      Lot of re-renders at different levels

  3. Props Drilling:

      Drilling of props from Parent --> Child --> GrandChild

      In Genereal, separate the props or state specific to the level( Component child/parent )
        Where You keep the ren-rendering controlled at particular level rather than rendering whole application

  4. useContext used to avoid props drilling but not the re-rendering

      context --> a base context for the entire application 
        or at particular component level

        hooks
          1. Create Context 
          2. useContext 
      
      Eg: theme --> light / dark theme for the entire application
          language --> language for the entire application
        
        Programming Language Selection on coding platform
      
      Provider: Provides the Context to the entire component tree
      Consume: useContext

      Advantage:
        Properties or state context on a grandparent component
        can be used by a grandchild with using a middle parent
      
      Disadvantage:
        Does not avoid the re-rendering of the child components

  5. Working with Forms & basic data processing in reactjs
    Please refer src/Profile.jsx for form handling using useState

Next Week:
  I will ask for Additional session where we will try to see,
    Some simple games.
  
  About how to put the layout of an application together
  6. ref in react

      useRef() --> hook used to access the DOM element

      ref.current === e.target

      ref cannot be used to change/alter the DOM it should be used only for actions on the application,

      1. Scrolling
      2. Sliding
      3. Play an audio
      4. Stop an audio

      ** Ref should not be used to alter the DOM, it should only be used to do actions like above **
  
  7. useReducer
